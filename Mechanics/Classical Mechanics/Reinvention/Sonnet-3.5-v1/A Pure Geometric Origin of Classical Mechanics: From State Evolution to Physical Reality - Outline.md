# A Pure Geometric Origin of Classical Mechanics: From State Evolution to Physical Reality

**Motto**: "Reality flows in the rivers of geometry"

## Core Ideas and Core Concepts

### Foundation Stone:
**State Evolution as Fundamental Reality**
- Physical reality is fundamentally about evolution of states
- Geometry emerges from evolution requirements
- All physical structures arise from preservation of evolution

### Key Principles:
1. **Preservation Principle**: Evolution must preserve fundamental structures
2. **Minimal Structure**: Only necessary geometric structures emerge
3. **Natural Hierarchy**: Physical laws arise from geometric necessities
