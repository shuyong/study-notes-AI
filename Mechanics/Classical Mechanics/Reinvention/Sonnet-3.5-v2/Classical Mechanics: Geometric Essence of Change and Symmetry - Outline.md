# Classical Mechanics: Geometric Essence of Change and Symmetry
**- A Foundational Reconstruction from First Principles -**

*"From the geometry of change emerges the algebra of symmetry"*

## Core Framework

### Central Thesis
Classical Mechanics is fundamentally about the **geometry of change** and its intrinsic **symmetries**. All physical laws emerge as necessary consequences of this geometric structure, revealing that mechanics is not just described by geometry—it is geometry itself.

### Core Concepts
1. **Change as Foundation**: Evolution of states as the primitive concept
2. **Geometric Necessity**: Physical laws as geometric requirements
3. **Symmetry-Conservation Unity**: Deep connection between invariance and conservation
4. **Variational Principles**: Action as geometric measure of change
5. **Unified Framework**: All formalisms as different views of the same geometric structure

## Document Summary

### Purpose

### Approach
1. Start from change as the primitive concept
2. Develop necessary geometric structures
3. Reveal physical laws as geometric requirements
4. Unify formalisms through geometric principles
5. Connect to modern physics through geometric bridges
